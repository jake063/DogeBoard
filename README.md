# Why Doge?
Because...why not doge. In reality, I wanted to do "doge" Because doge is a staple of memes, and I love memes. Doge is so recognizable in the meme community that even if you hate doge, you know he was and still is an ever-evolving meme. Like cancer, he keeps evolving and changing and mutating into different forms.
